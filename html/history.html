    <h6><b><em>Fun Fact: Volleyball is 127 years old</em></b></h6>

    <main>
        <h3><em><u>How it all started</u></em></h3>
        <p>

            William G. Morgan, a physical director of the Young Men’s Christian Association <em>(YMCA)</em> in Holyoke, Massachusetts,
            invented volleyball in 1895 as an indoor sport for businessmen who were not fond of basketball. Morgan called the sport <em>“mintonette,”</em> until a professor from Springfield College
            in Massachusetts noted the volleying nature of this play and proposed the name of <em>“volleyball.”</em> The original rules
            were written by Morgan and printed in the first edition of the Official Handbook of the Athletic League of
            the Young Men’s Christian Associations of North America in 1897. This game soon caught the attention of
            both sexes in schools, playgrounds, the armed forces, and other organizations in the United States, and it
            was subsequently introduced to other countries.
            <br><br>
            In 1916, the rules were issued by the YMCA and National Collegiate Athletic Association <em>(NCAA)</em>. In 1922, the first
            nationwide tournament in the U.S. was hosted by the National YMCA Physical Education Committee
            in New York City. From 1928, the USVBA, now known as USA Volleyball <em>(USAV)</em>, has conducted annual
            national men’s and senior men’s <em>(age 35 and older)</em> volleyball championships, except during 1944 and 1945.
            Its women’s division was started in 1949, and a senior women’s division <em>(age 30 and older)</em> was added in 1977.
